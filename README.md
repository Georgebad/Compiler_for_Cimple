# Compiler_for_Cimple
This repository contains a compiler implemented with python for Cimple Language

## But what is Cimple?
Cimple is a small, educational programming language. Reminiscent of the C language, from which it derives ideas and structures, 
but is considerably smaller, both in supported structures and programming capabilities.
The name Cimple comes from the C language and the word implementation, while it sounds like the word
simple to emphasize its simplicity.
